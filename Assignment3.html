            <h1 class="responsibility">Responsibility toward my community
            </h1>
            <p>If i ever become rich. Inshallah i'll distribute zakat to my community. I try to get all the poor people
                out of debt. Citizenship in our communities and the responsibility we each have is a basic belief
                addressed in Islamic thought and practice and is supported by hadith as well as the Holy Qur’an. Actions
                are preferred over stagnation or indifference. Apathy, or a lack of interest, in particular, is a human
                trait which is discouraged and abhorred in Islam. It is, therefore, beneficial for the individual, in
                whatever capacity, to take an active role in the communities we live in. <br>
            </p>
            <hr>

            <strong> The Holy Qur’an says,</strong>

            “Everyone is guarded and protected on all sides by the order of God. God does not change the condition
            of a nation unless it changes what is in its heart. When God wants to punish a people, there is no way
            to escape from it and no one besides God will protect them from it. “(13:11) <br>
            <hr>

            We are very much responsible for making an effort to produce significant change and impact in our lives,
            both within and around us. Staying sedentary gets us nowhere. After all, one can never get from point A
            to point B by standing still. Change and progress can only come from action, and this is every
            individual’s responsibility to themselves as well as to our communities. Read our blog on How to Help
            Alleviate Hunger in our Community, for more on how to get involved.
